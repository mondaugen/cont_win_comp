This collection of files contains LaTeX packages for posters of ISO A3
size and larger (ISO A0 is the default size). American paper sizes and
custom paper is supported. In particular, poster.cls defines a
document class which allows cutting and pasting most of an article to
a poster without any editing (save reducing the size). A (pdf) manual is 
included as well.

NOTE that this version does work for LaTeX, not just pdfLaTeX, as in
previous versions. However, xdvi produces strange results, though a 
recent version of dvips does create good ps-files from the dvi files.

Also note that logos must either be put in the current working directory
or in the directories of your LaTeX distribution. For some reason 
graphicspath settings are ignored. 

An example can be found in the sciposterexample directory.
